	    Despite what many might think, Turtles is well known across hundreds of nations all over the world. Turtles has been around for several centuries and has a very important meaning in the lives of many. It would be safe to assume that Turtles is going to be around for a long time and have an enormous impact on the lives of many people.test for introduce3

		Social And Cultural Factors
		
		Turtles has a large role in American Culture. Many people can often be seen taking part in activities associated with Turtles. This is partly because people of most ages can be involved and families are brought together by this. Generally a person who displays their dislike for Turtles may be considered an outcast.
		
		Economic Factors
		
		It is not common practice to associate economics with Turtles. Generally, Turtles would be thought to have no effect on our economic situation, but there are in fact some effects. The sales industry associated with Turtles is actually a 2.3 billion dollar a year industry and growing each year. The industry employs nearly 150,000 people in the United States alone. It would be safe to say that Turtles play an important role in American economics and shouldn't be taken for granted.
		
		Environmental Factors
		
		After a three month long research project, I've been able to conclude that Turtles doesn't negatively effect the environment at all. A Turtles did not seem to result in waste products and couldn't be found in forests, jungles, rivers, lakes, oceans, etc... In fact, Turtles produced some positive effects on our sweet little nature.
		
		Political Factors
		
		Oh does Turtles ever influence politics. Last year 5 candidates running for some sort of position used Turtles as the primary topic of their campaign. A person might think Turtles would be a bad topic to lead a campaign with, but in fact with the social and environmental impact is has, this topic was able to gain a great number of followers. These 5 candidates went 4 for 5 on winning their positions.
		
		Conclusion
		
		Turtles seem to be a much more important idea that most give credit for. Next time you see or think of Turtles, think about what you just read and realize what is really going on. It is likely you under valued Turtles before, but will now start to give the credited needed and deserved.
